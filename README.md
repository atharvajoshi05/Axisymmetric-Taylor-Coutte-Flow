# Axisymmetric-Taylor-Coutte-Flow
consists of a viscous fluid confined in the gap between two rotating cylinders. For low angular velocities, measured by the Reynolds number Re, the flow is steady and purely azimuthal. Taylor-Couette flow is characterized by three dimensionless numbers: a) 𝜂 = 𝑅1/𝑅2, the ratio of the inner cylidner radius 𝑅1 to the outer cylinder radius 𝑅2; b) 𝜇 = Ω2/Ω1, the ratio of the OUTER cylinder rotation rate Ω2 to the inner rate Ω1; c) Re = Ω1𝑅1𝛿/𝜈, the Reynolds numbers, where 𝛿 = 𝑅2 − 𝑅1, the gap width between the cylinders
